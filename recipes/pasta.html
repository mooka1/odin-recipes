<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is one of those pasta recipes that I learnt very early when I started cooking (along with basic dal). When I was younger white sauce pasta used to my favorite. And since I didn’t know how to make it and mom never made it either, I would always look for occasions so that we could eat out and I could order my favorite white sauce pasta.</p>

    <p>So when I started cooking, I knew I had to learn to make a good homemade white sauce pasta loaded with veggies. This isn’t health food but I make this when we want to eat a nice cozy bowl of pasta. It’s also great to make when you have friends over for dinner or even during holidays! My brothers and sisters love this pasta a lot, so whenever I go to India, I make this on repeat. I add tons of cheese when I make for them because they love it that way.</p>

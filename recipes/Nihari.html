    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>From the royal kitchens of the Mughals, nalli nihari is a deliciously smooth flour based Indian stew with slow cooked lamb and a myriad of spices. This mutton nihari recipe takes 3-4 hours to cook but with this nehari masala you are guaranteed to get a flavourful nihari.

        This nihari gosht recipe is a traditional Pakistani dish that took over taste buds of people all across India and Pakistan. Nihari is considered to be the national dish of Pakistan and with this nalli nihari recipe, you will be able to cook royal food in the comforts of your own home. Serve alongside some fresh homemade naan for a delicious dinner.</p>
        
        <p>Nihari is one of those dishes that can really stand on its own. It has a strong hint of spice, beautifully tender meat then garnished with ginger and coriander. This meal is something that everyone will love.

            I know a lot of people use nihari masala packets, but it really is so simple to make your own. This recipe will show you how to do exactly that. You won’t need to use store-bought ever again. You could even grind a large batch of this nihari masala then store it in a mason jar. It will keep for up to 3 months.
            
            Traditionally nihari is made with shank pieces. You could use mutton, beef, or lamb. Whichever suits you. However, it is important to use bones as this is what creates the flavour of that delicious stew. Nihari wouldn’t really work with boneless meat.</p>
